# 👋 Hi, I'm Ariana (aka @aiwithari)

I help leaders at small to mid-sized enterprises build **intelligent leadership infrastructure** — so they can scale sustainably, reduce operational complexity, and achieve measurable ROI from AI investments.

After building a fast-growing startup that struggled under fragmented AI infrastructure, I discovered a vital truth:  
**It’s not about more tools — it’s about smarter, cohesive intelligence that flows through your entire organization.**
